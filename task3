My approach to solving this issue would be to prioritize Task 2, as it is for a priority customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days. I would inform the account manager of Task 1, Manoj, that I will not be able to meet the original due date for the task due to a family emergency and ask for an extension of 3 days. I would then work on completing Task 2 as quickly as possible to ensure that it is ready for the priority customer's campaign to go live on time.

To inform the account managers of both customers about my approach, I would send an internal message as follows:

Subject: Update on task progress

Dear Manoj,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to meet the original due date for Task 1 due to a family emergency. I will be requesting an extension of 3 days for this task. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,
Sagar

Dear Ravi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will be prioritizing Task 2 due to the go-live date of the campaign. I will be working on completing this task as quickly as possible to ensure it is ready on time.

Sincerely,
Sagar

To inform the customer about the delay, I would send an email as follows:
Subject: Delay in task completion

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
